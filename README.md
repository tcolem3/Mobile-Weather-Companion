# Mobile-Weather-Companion

To install this apk for those who might be unfamiliar, follow the steps in this link (https://www.wikihow.tech/Install-APK-Files-on-Android). Within part 2 of the directions ignore steps 1, 2, and 3 as you will be downloading my apk from this repo and not how the linked directions tell you to look up.

Before opening the app, look at the png file titled "Capture with labels" to reference the terminology used in the app.

Once apk is loaded, open the app to begin navigation.

From the top to the bottom, the app will display these fields:
- An image of the current weather
- The current city being displayed
- The weather for the current city
- Description of the current weather for the current city
- The current time

A list of the input fields and buttons a user can interact with: 
- The input field: Type in any city or zipcode 
- The enter button: Press this to look up whatever has been entered into the input field
- The save button: Press this to save the city that is currently in the display field. When the app is reopened, this is the city that will be displayed when the app is reopened from previously being closed.
- The refresh button: Press this button to go back to the city that has last been saved within the app.
- Current location button: With the location enabled on the device, when pressed will present the weather based on user's current location.
